# MATLAB Examples

This folder contains examples showcasing SMILER's capabilities in MATLAB.

**example_extended.m** provides a comprehensive example of possible experimental runs, including a batch test of default parameter settings as well as two additional experimental runs: the execution of AWS and IMSIG over different colour spaces, and the execution of AIM using different basis function filter sets. This script also checks for SMILER setup, and if SMILER has not yet been setup it will perform the necessary call to iSMILER.
